/**
 * This class represents several assets that are meant to be grouped together
 * into a single file as part of a transaction.  It is assumed that instances
 * will interact with a GroupedAssetTransactionManager.
 * <br/>
 * <b>Note: </b>This class is not thread safe.
 *
 *
 * <p><b>Main points to consider</b></p>
 * <ol>
 *    <li>
 * The transaction allows the same asset to occur multiple times within a group.
 * This facilitates the case where a script or other resource may wish to be
 * duplicated multiple times to avoid repetition in code, and other
 * unforeseeable usages.  It is therefore imperative that clients add only the
 * resources intended.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 * The transaction <i>must</i> be closed before any processing may be performed
 * on the underlying data.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 * The identifier is a unique representation in an MD5 format for any given set
 * of URLs.  It is assumed that the identifier will be used in the filename of
 * the resulting asset once processing is complete.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 * List is used to hold assets in the transaction, and ordering is guaranteed
 * to occur as given.
 *    </li>
 * </ol>

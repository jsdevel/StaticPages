This is always relative \n         to your domain. The resulting prefix is \n         never allowed to end in '/'. This means \n         that '/' would be converted to '' and \n         '/url/' would be converted to '/url'. \n         The default value is '' which will \n         result in all assets being prefixed \n         with '/'. :) \n\n      --log4j-properties\n         Sets the location of the \n         log4j.properties. By default, \n         StaticPages looks in the current dir of \n         the jar for the properties file. This \n         may be an absolute or relative path. \n         Relative paths are resolved against the \n         StaticPages.jar file. \n\n      --log4j-interval\n         Sets the amount of time to watch for \n         log4j.properties changes. \n\n      --enable-compression\n         Enables or disables compression. \n\n      --enable-dev-mode\n         Enables dev mode. Certain features are \n         only available when dev mode is \n         enabled. \n\n      --max-data-uri-size-in-bytes\n         Sets the maximum size (in bytes) of \n         data uri embedded resources within css. \n         The default is the limit imposed by IE8 \n         (32768). \n\n      --max-wait-time-to-validate-external-link\n         Sets the number of milliseconds to wait \n         for an external link reference to \n         return. \n\n      --prefix-to-ignore-files\n";   }

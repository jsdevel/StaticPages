This \n         builds all the pages in your project. \n         Only the assets that are declared in \n         your pages and views will be built. \n\n      --new-project\n         Creates a default project in the \n         specified directory. This overwrites \n         the default files / resources provided \n         by the framework. All other existing \n         files are left untouched. Nothing is \n         built by using this option. \n\n      --asset-prefix-in-browser\n         Provides a way to prefix assets as seen \n         in the browser. This is always relative \n         to your domain. The resulting prefix is \n         never allowed to end in '/'. This means \n         that '/' would be converted to '' and \n         '/url/' would be converted to '/url'. \n         The default value is '' which will \n         result in all assets being prefixed \n         with '/'. :) \n\n      --dev-asset-prefix-in-browser\n         The asset prefix to use when \n         enable-dev-mode is true. See \n         asset-prefix-in-browser for more \n         detail. \n\n      --enable-compression\n         Enables or disables compression. \n\n      --clean\n         Cleans all resources in the given \n         projce build directory when true. \n\n      --enable-asset-fingerprinting\n         Enables or disables asset \n         fingerprinting. An asset fingerprint \n         contains a unix timestamp of the \n         following format just before the file \n         extension: 'file.UTC23452345345.js'. \n         The benefit of using a fingerprint in \n         this manner, is that you can easily \n         write a recursive directory scanner \n         that can clean up old assets from time \n         to time. \n\n      --enable-dev-mode\n         Enables dev mode. Certain features are \n         only available when dev mode is \n         enabled. \n\n      --max-data-uri-size-in-bytes\n         Sets the maximum size (in bytes) of \n         data uri embedded resources within css. \n         The default is the limit imposed by IE8 \n         (32768). \n\n      --max-wait-time-to-validate-external-link\n         Sets the number of milliseconds to wait \n         for an external link reference to \n         return. \n\n      --prefix-to-ignore-files\n         Files with this prefix will be ignored. \n\n      --enable-logging-info\n         Enables INFO level logging. \n\n      --enable-logging-warn\n         Enables WARN level logging. \n\n      --enable-logging-error\n         Enables ERROR level logging. \n\n      --enable-logging-fatal\n         Enables FATAL level logging. \n\n      --enable-logging-debug\n         Enables DEBUG level logging. \n\n      --logging-level\n         Controls the level of logging. \n\n         0 (default) outputs the type of log in \n         caps, I.E. INFO message \n\n         1 outputs the classname 2 outputs the \n         line number the log was called 3 \n         outputs the file name where the log was \n         called 4 outputs the method name where \n         the log was called 5 outputs a full \n         stack trace on fatal logs \n\n";   }
